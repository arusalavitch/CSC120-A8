Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
  My pet gerbil in his little cage. I have two gerbils (one belongs to my roommate). My gerbil's name is Gluten (because I have celiac) and my roommate's gerbil is named Wheezer (after the band and because they have severe asthma).
- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
  I didn't add any other additional methods. 
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
  Have fun with it! I know I did. Also, it's funny to interpret in the case of random objects/classes.
